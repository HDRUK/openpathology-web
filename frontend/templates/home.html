      OpenPathology is a new project being built by
      the <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">EBM DataLab</a> at the
      University of Oxford.  In spring 2019 we obtained funding from HDRUK
      (<a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/funding-obtained-for-openpathology-pilot-project/">read
      more</a>) to build a prototype, which will be delivered by the end of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been a rapid expansion in the ordering of blood
      tests over the last two decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      At OpenPathology, we are setting out to bring all pathology
      data together, in one place, so that users can explore
      variation in the way that clinicians are ordering tests, and
      give useful feedback to doctors.

    <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>

    Research by <a href="{% url 'about' %}">members of our team</a> has
    already
    shown <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487169">enormous
    increases</a> in the use of tests,
    and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556075">substantial
    variation.  We have also written
    a <a href="https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/content/8/1/e000349">quality
    improvement report</a> on the monitoring of chronic conditions.
