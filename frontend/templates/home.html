      OpenPathology is a new project being built by
      the <a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/">EBM DataLab</a> at the
      University of Oxford.  In spring 2019 we obtained funding from HDRUK
      (<a href="https://ebmdatalab.net/funding-obtained-for-openpathology-pilot-project/">read
      more</a>) to build a prototype, which will be delivered by the end of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our aim is to create an innovative, high impact pathology benchmarking tool that improves patient care, using advanced data science presented in simple terms, to give GPs simple, actionable insights.
      </p>
      At OpenPathology, we are setting out to bring all pathology
      data together, in one place, so that users can explore
      variation in the way that clinicians are ordering tests, and
      give useful feedback to doctors.
    </p>
    <h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
    <p>
      There has been a rapid expansion in the ordering of blood
      tests over the last two decades.
    </p>
    <p>
  Clinicians currently receive almost no feedback on their test request rates, or how these relate to national norms. Our live, up-to-date pathology monitoring tool will show clinicians and policy-makers how recent testing rates and performance on specific measures of pathology test appropriateness compare with other practices. This will highlight areas requiring further investigation to improve patient care. It will also give live data on overall trends in test use over time for policymakers, commissioners and researchers.

    Research by <a href="{% url 'about' %}">members of our team</a> has
    already
    shown <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487169">enormous
    increases</a> in the use of tests,
    and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29556075">substantial
    variation</a>.  We have also written
    a <a href="https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/content/8/1/e000349">quality
          improvement report</a> on the monitoring of chronic conditions.
