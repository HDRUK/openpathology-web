<h1>Get involved</h1>
<p class="lead">We are actively seeking NHS Trusts and labs who would like to
  include their data in this project.</p>

<p>In addition, we are always keen to hear from more policymakers, hospital pathologoist, public health staff, funders, microbiologists, GPs, researchers and data scientists!</p>
<p>
  To express an interest, write
  to us
  at <a href="mailto:ebmdatalab@phc.ox.ac.uk">ebmdatalab@phc.ox.ac.uk</a>.</p>

<h2>Why get involved as a Trust or Lab?</h2>
<p>We expect participating regions to see the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved patient care</li>
  <li>Reduced costs</li>
  <li>Better documentation and reduction of lab workloads</li>
  <li>More effective collaboration with GP Practices and commissioners</li>
</ul>

<p>These benefits will be achieved through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standardisation of data, supporting benchmarking against other regions</li>
  <li>Access to a suite of free online tools for supporting audit and feedback, including
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to identify unnecessary test requests</li>
      <li>Measures of efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness presented in easy-to-understand charts for each practice and lab</li>
      <li>Time trends</li>
      <li>Automated feedback by email for interested GP practices on unusual testing variation</li>
      <li>A per-region dashboard showing top-level summary trends and alerts, with national benchmarks</li>
      <li>Data showing trends over time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All the normalised, processed data and analyses will be available as raw data downloads for further analysis within each lab or trust</li>
</ul>



<h2>How to get involved</h2>

<p class="lead">The pilot tool will be built using extracts from participating labsâ€™ LIMS. The minimum a partner needs to do is provide LIMS data in the <a href="{% url 'data_format' %}">OpenPathology format</a>, once a month. At the end of every month we will update dashboards for every participating Lab.</p>
<p>Ideally, you would allocate some time to provide explanations of known issues and anomalies. We will host occasional meetings in Oxford to discuss development of the tools.</p>
<p>During the prototype period, we are also able to help write software to convert the raw output of a LIMS to this format. Get in touch at <a href="mailto:hello@ebmdatalab.net">hello@ebmdatalab.net</a> to express an interest.</p>

<h2>Information Governance</h2>
<p>Patient privacy is assured through the University of Oxford's extensive "Privacy by design" protocols. Once our impact assessment has been authorised, we will share it in full here. In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data will be submitted to our secured area using best-practice encryption (SSH over a VPN); we will need to liaise with your technical team to set up clients and credentials, following which data uploads will work in the same way, each month.</li>
<li>All data sent in this way will remain in a secured server within the University, and processed to ensure it is anonymised and aggregated before it can leave this area.</li>
<li>Raw data relating to time periods older than 5 years will be routinely deleted.</li>
<li>We will also sign individual data-sharing agreements with each Trust, as required by their data protection protocols.</li>
</ul>
